Title: Simulate and Fit a Stochastic Model of Mosquito Population Dynamics
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Charlie", "Whittaker", email = "charles.whittaker16@imperial.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides capability to simulate a stochastic model of mosquito population dynamics
    based on that developed by White et al, 2011. Also provides capacity to fit the model to 
    observed mosquito catch data. This fitting is carried out using a Bayesian Framework- specifically,
    using a Particle Filter in tandem with an algorithm based on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC.
